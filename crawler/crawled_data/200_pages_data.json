Schust demonstrated an early interest in architecture and was enrolled at the Kingswood School for Girls, adjacent to the Cranbrook Academy of Art. While at Kingswood, Florence befriended Eilel Saarinen, whom she would later study under at Cranbrook. Warmly embraced by the Saarinen family, Florence vacationed with them in Finland, enjoyed the company of their accomplished friends, and formed a very close relationship with Eliel’s son, Eero. The connections she made and the skills she developed while at Cranbrook were the foundations of Florence Schust’s incredible design education and pioneering career. With recommendations from Eliel Saarinen and Alvar Aalto, Florence went on to study under some of the greatest 20th century architects, including Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Portraits of Florence Knoll through the years. Images from the Knoll Archive. In 1941 Florence moved to New York where she met Hans Knoll who was establishing his furniture company. With Florence’s design skills and Hans’ business acumen and salesmanship, the pair, who married in 1946, grew the nascent company into an international arbiter of style and design. Florence also seeded contributions with her friends Eero Saarinen, Harry Bertoia, and Mies van der Rohe. “She had that ability, to critique [something], to tear it apart and put it back together. She was something else.” —Bob Longwell Florence Knoll paste-up for Cowles Publication. Image from the Knoll Archive. In creating the revolutionary Knoll Planning Unit, Florence Knoll defined the standard for the modern corporate interiors of post-war America. Drawing on her background in architecture, she introduced modern notions of efficiency, space planning, and comprehensive design to office planning. Florence ardently maintained that she did not merely decorate space. She created it. The Planning Unit rigorously researched and surveyed each client — assessing their needs, defining patterns of use and understanding company hierarchies — before presenting a comprehensive design, informed by the principles of modernism and beautifully executed in signature Knoll style. Florence and the Planning Unit were responsible for the interiors of some of America’s largest corporations, including IBM, GM and CBS. Cowles Publication interior, designed by Florence Knoll. Image from the Knoll Archive. As part of her work with the Planning Unit, Florence frequently contributed furniture designs to the Knoll catalog. She humbly referred to her furniture designs as the “meat and potatoes,” filler among the standout pieces of Bertoia, Mies, and Saarinen. However, with her attention to detail, eye for proportion, and command of the modern aesthetic, many of her designs have become as revered and celebrated as those of her colleagues. “I designed the architectural [elements] that were needed to make the room work, things like the walls, [tables] and sofas.” —Florence Knoll Florence Knoll-designed Coffee and Side Tables. Image from the Knoll Archive. After the tragic death of Hans Knoll in 1955, Florence Knoll led the company as president through uncertain times. In 1960 she resigned the presidency to focus on directing design and development and, in 1965 after pioneering an industry and defining the landscape and aesthetic of the corporate office, Florence Knoll Bassett (she remarried in 1957) retired from the company. Her contributions to Knoll, and to the rise of modernism in America, are immeasurable.

Click + Collect Click + Collect Flat Rate Delivery Flat Rate Delivery Ways to Pay Ways to Pay Key Features - Mango Timber The timber used in this piece is sustainably sourced Mango Wood. Each plank is individually treated in a computer controlled kiln to reduce the chance of any cracks or warping in its long future as a furniture component. This piece has been handcrafted by one of our Vast Masters, these individual cabinet makers have been manufacturing Vast products for over a decade. Using traditional joinery techniques to maximise the timber's natural beauty is a big part of the unique look of each Vast product. We call this \"working with the grain\". After the joinery is complete it is then hand sanded and hand polished with several coats of high grade German lacquer so it will last for generations! Country of Origin: India Product Care - Timber Hardwood is a natural material which reacts to its environment and although our manufacturing process allows for normal expansion and contraction, extreme high or low humidity may cause more swelling than normal. To minimise movement and ensure longevity of your purchase we recommend taking good care of your piece as outlined below: Dust regularly with a clean cotton cloth; Use tablecloths, table runners and coasters to help prevent scratches to the surface and wipe up any spills immediately; To nourish and protect your furniture we recommend waxing with a natural beeswax every 6-12 months. Only use natural wax , oil or water based cleaning products. Do not use solvent based cleaning products that may contain silicone or alcohol, as this may react and permanently damage the lacquer. Do not expose to fragrant oils, insect repellent lotion, or nail polish remover as these are often solvent based and will damage the lacquer Avoid placing your furniture near fireplaces, in direct sunlight or under heating/cooling vents. Do not leave hot items or ice cold items directly on the surface of the table as water marking may occur. Any metal work featuring on your product has been powder coated. Any damage to the surface should be contained as soon as possible to prevent rusting.

It has an inlaid dark brown leather writing surface, two drawers and a cable access hole to each side at the rear of the desk. This item requires basic assembly or can be delivered white glove including assembly. Dimensions Metric Imperial Millimetres: 1260w × 700d × 830h (730 desk height) Inches: 49.61w × 27.56d × 32.68h (28.74 desk height) Millimetres: 1260w × 700d × 830h (730 desk height) Inches: 49.61w × 27.56d × 32.68h (28.74 desk height) Dimension drawing Materials and finishes Black American walnut Black walnut is a hardwood with a rich and straight-grained timber, it can display many unique characteristics, such as knots and variations in depth of tone. The walnut we source is native to North America. We use a protective lacquer finish which enables the timber to age gracefully without heavy discolouration and withstand daily spillage. European oak European oak is a temperate white oak hardwood native to Europe. It presents a golden to light brown hue with a minimal grain pattern. We use a protective white oil finish to allow the timber to age gracefully without heavy discolouration and withstand daily spillage. Dark brown house leather Our house leather is a dark brown aniline leather. As such, it may reveal natural markings such as scarring, growth marks and variation in tone and colour. These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time. Care guide Oiled wood An oiled finish is a durable natural looking finish that can be revitalised (and if necessary, more easily repaired). Oiled finishes require some low level maintenance to keep the wood protected and looking its best. Day to day cleaning: • Wipe clean with a damp non-abrasive cloth, then using a dry cloth remove any excess moisture. • Wipe up wine, oil and any liquids that might stain as quickly as possible. • To ensure the finish remains as resilient as possible to staining we recommend Osmo Wash & Care (8016) as it contains soaps and oils to both nourish and prevent the wood from drying out. 6 monthly replenishment / more stubborn stains: • As the table is used it can dry out as the oil can thin with wear and washing with water alone. If the table looks dry or you have a more stubborn stain we recommend using a revitalising Osmo Liquid Wax Cleaner (white 3087) for oak pieces and (clear 3029) for walnut pieces Do not: • Leave any water, wine, oil or liquids that might stain – wipe up as quickly as possible. (Oil provides a semi-permeable finish, which means some liquids can penetrate the surface if left) • Use ANY chemical cleaning products or bleach as this will remove the protective layer of oil and it will then stain. Lacquered wood A lacquered finish requires very little maintenance and is durable and resistant to spills. Day to day cleaning: • Wipe clean with a damp cloth then buff off with a clean, dry cloth. Do not: • Leave any wine, oil or liquids that might stain – wipe up as quickly as possible. • Use any abrasive cleaning products or bleach as this could damage the protective layer of lacquer. House leather Our house leather is a pure aniline leather. As such, it may reveal natural markings such as scarring, growth marks and variation in tone and colour. These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time. We recommend you avoid placing furniture in direct sunlight or next to strong heat sources as this can cause aniline leather to discolour or dry out prematurely. Day to day cleaning: • As an untreated material, the leather is naturally absorbent. If cleaning is essential for small marks, carefully dab with a clean, lint-free cloth, and vacuum gently using the small brush attachment. For more pronounced marks, please refer to a professional leather cleaner. Do not: • Use any abrasive or chemical cleaning products or bleach, as this will damage the leather.

These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time. We recommend you avoid placing furniture in direct sunlight or next to strong heat sources as this can cause aniline leather to discolour or dry out prematurely. Day to day cleaning: • As an untreated material, the leather is naturally absorbent. If cleaning is essential for small marks, carefully dab with a clean, lint-free cloth, and vacuum gently using the small brush attachment. For more pronounced marks, please refer to a professional leather cleaner. Do not: • Use any abrasive or chemical cleaning products or bleach, as this will damage the leather.

It contains no waste-wood fiber so it won't absorb any water and won't rot, splinter or crack. DURAWOOD® is fade resistant and will never require paint, stain or any kind of sealant. Stainless Steel Hardware: High quality 316 marine-grade stainless steel hardware is used on our outdoor furniture, compared to 304 marine-grade used by our competitors, for superior rust resistance. All hardware is painted to match the color of the furniture and strategically place to conceal each bolt. Mortise and Tenon Joints: We use this ancient form of carpentry, where board meets board, to allow our furniture to fit together and help make it sturdier; rather than just being held together with nuts and bolts. $949.99 FREE Shipping Deluxe Sunbrella Cushion Swing - Midori Indigo by Hatteras Hammocks Swing Only - Stand and Accessories Not Included!

Samples We provide Next Day shipping on our 4 Popular North American Hardwoods, to order a set please click HERE Description Specifications Wood Finish The Enso Platform Bed embodies quiet sophistication, where the warmth of natural cherry wood comes alive with artistry. Its balanced form and subtle curves echo the calm strength of traditional, Japanese-inspired design, with every part shaped for beauty and harmony. Though minimal in appearance, this bed’s construction demands exceptional precision, brought to life through the skill of artisans in or workship in Columbus, Ohio. Built for enduring comfort and timeless beauty, this solid wood bed frame is a modern heirloom designed to last for generations. Benefits of Premium Solid Wood - There’s a warmth to natural hardwood that no other material can replicate. Its rich tones and organic grain pattern with subtle variations bring a sense of life and authenticity to your home. - Beyond its beauty, solid wood offers exceptional strength and longevity—aging gracefully and developing a deeper character over time. - Chosen by craftsmen for its integrity and timeless appeal, it’s the foundation of furniture built to last for generations. Enso Platform Bed Best Features - The true beauty of the design lies in the subtle, challenging details like the gentle curves reminiscent of the Myojin torii , allowing the piece to serve as an organic and calming accent in the bedroom. - Constructed entirely from premium solid hardwood, this bed frame provides an incredibly sturdy, lasting, and reliable foundation for comfortable, peaceful sleep. - The frame is expertly handcrafted by our skilled artisans and built using time-honored, traditional joinery throughout, where the robust and honest craftsmanship is the highest expression of the design. - For your health and peace of mind, the entire piece is finished with a certified organic, zero-VOC wood finish , ensuring a completely natural and non-toxic sleeping environment. All Enso Beds Have a 12\" Tall Platform and a 44\" tall headboard with 10.25\" clearance under the bed. This bed frame is designed to accommodate mattresses 10-14” thick. If your mattress is different, we can customize a frame to fit your needs at no added cost. Twin - 42 x 79 Full - 58 x 79 Queen - 66 x 84 King - 82 x 84 Cal King - 78 x 89 Enso Platform Bed Tear Sheet Download Wood Selection We source only premium-grade hardwood that exceeds standard furniture industry specifications. While most furniture makers use Number 1 Common grade lumber (typically 66-83% clear wood yield), we hand-select from FAS (First and Seconds) and Select grades that yield 83-100% clear, defect-free wood. This superior grading means wider boards, better color consistency, and exceptional grain matching throughout each piece. Our craftsmen spend considerable time matching individual boards for color harmony, character, and grain pattern - a process that results in furniture with visual continuity rarely achieved with standard-grade lumber. These higher grades provide longer, wider clear cuttings that allow us to showcase the wood's natural beauty without interruption from defects. Wood Species We never stain our wood. Each piece is crafted from 100% natural solid wood in cherry, walnut, white oak, and hard maple - the actual species your furniture will be built from. This approach preserves the wood's authentic grain patterns and natural character while ensuring superior structural integrity. Our Signature Finish Every piece receives our proprietary organic finish - a carefully formulated blend of food-grade certified oils and natural waxes developed exclusively for our furniture. This non-toxic, zero-VOC finish penetrates deep into the wood fibers to enhance natural beauty while providing exceptional protection against scratches, moisture, and daily wear. Key Benefits: Enhanced Beauty : Natural oils highlight the wood's grain and develop a rich patina over time that adds character Superior Durability : Our oil-based formula creates a protective barrier that's more resilient than many conventional finishes Easy Maintenance & Repair : Unlike film finishes that chip or peel, our penetrating finish can be easily refreshed and spot-repaired without refinishing the entire piece Health-Conscious : Food-grade ingredients make our finish safe around children and those with chemical sensitivities This finishing system represents years of development and testing, resulting in furniture that not only looks beautiful but improves with age and use. Dining tables feature our commercial-grade finish system, providing restaurant-level durability for water resistance and intensive daily use. Please contact us if you'd like our proprietary organic blend instead. You may also like Handcrafted Excellence, Customer Approved 4.9 321+ verified reviews \"“...The bed frame is solid wood, with the custom finish one would expect from fine furniture. It is beautiful, aesthetically soothing, and makes me smile every time I see it. I splurged for the organic mattress (which will outlast me) and am so happy I did. The comfort is amazing. The delivery and setup is the best I've ever experienced with any home delivery, and they even removed my old bed and stacked it neatly at the curb. I'll be visiting them next year for a sofa. Highly recommend TY Fine Furniture!”\" — Sabrena Sally \"They truly do an amazing job. The furniture quality cannot be beat. We asked them to build multiple pieces of furniture, most from their designs but also some customization. They were extremely helpful throughout the entire process. What matters most however, is the final product, which is incredible. We are so happy with our purchase, this furniture is art.\" — Jonathan Styer \"We are delighted with the Sunrise Collection Classic Platform bed and Enso Collection dresser, which was artfully customized as a perfect mate for the bed. From the showroom experience through delivery, T.Y. Fine Furniture demonstrated sincere and thoughtful customer care, elite workmanship and justified pride in product. From design and engineering to wood selection to the crafting, assembling and set-up, this business is first-rate.\" — Mark Ellis \"From start to finish we had an extremely positive experience working with T.Y. Fine Furniture. We went to so many big name furniture stores before discovering this store. We were searching for a leather couch and ottoman and found a great selection at T.Y. Arletta was extremely patient with us as we came back multiple times deciding on colors and styles. Once we settled on what we wanted, she stayed in regular contact with us so we knew when to expect our items and their delivery service was great as well. We will definitely use them again if we have a need in the future.\" — Kirstin Krumsee \"After looking at many options online, we decided on the One bed frame, and while more expensive than most rivals online, you get what you pay for. This is a handmade, very high quality bed frame with premium hardware and a flawless finish. It takes time for them to make this bed frame, but once it's finished, it's safely packed and shipped quickly. This bed frame will last a lifetime, and it's set back leg will assure that you don't break a toe in the middle of the night. If you are on the fence, buy it! If you think it's too expensive, enjoy your cheap, squeaky bed frame.\" — Tracy Hancock The T.Y. Difference Authenticity Handmade in Columbus by master artisans using traditional joinery techniques, each piece represents true investment-grade furniture that honors both the earth and your legacy—where sustainability meets heirloom luxury.

Shop By Deparment Bedroom Set Living Room Set Entertainment Mattress Dining Room Set Home Office Set Outdoor Accessories View All Our Happy Customers We have been customers for over 13 years. Charlie has always gone above and beyond with great customer service! We recommend them to all our friends. Just recently we needed an adjustable bed after my mom’s injury and we needed ASAP to be able to bring her mom from the hospital. As always Charlie made it happen! Great store and great employees!!!! Caryl H. I have shopped at Wayne’s Furniture for years and always had a Great experience. Charlie is the greatest salesman and very honest about his knowledge in furniture. When something goes wrong with the furniture like the switches on the couch or chair he always sends Mike who is very Knowledgeable and fixes it instead of buying new furniture. Charlie is trustworthy and makes sure his customers are happy with the service provided. GREAT job Charlie keep up the good work!!!! Tammy B. I found there is a great reason why Wayne's Fine Furniture has been around for so long - it's their great knowledge of the furniture industry, ability to navigate the current logistical challenges, and awesome customer service that puts Wayne's above its competitors. Charlie was a true partner through the process, helping to troubleshoot when my furniture was held up in transit. I would definitely recommend Wayne's!! Susanne K. By far one of the most positive experiences you can get at a furniture store, Charlie goes above and beyond to make sure you are completely satisfied even a year after the sale was done. That’s the type of service and commitment you just see less and less of these days. Would highly recommend for your next furniture purchase! Also the prices and quality are unmatched. Nick K. My husband and I bought our very first home a couple months back so we decided to furnish our new home. We shopped and shopped until we came across this mom and pop store Wayne’s Furniture. We went in and furnished the master bedroom as well as my youngest sons room. Charlie is great! Super customer friendly savvy, fast delivery. I LOVE my bed and anyone who tours my home comments on my bed! My sons first time in his own room and he was too excited to start decorating! Thanks again Wayne’s Furniture- check them out. 5/5 stars for me Shaura H. I was first introduced to Wayne’s furniture by my brother. Who only makes recommendations if he knows the company or person is reputable. Needless to say, Charlie and his staff did not disappoint. Even, with uncontrollable delivery delays they kept us updated on every step of the way. If you want quality furniture and good service use Waynes!!! Jackie B. Give us a Call!

        "text": "× View all collections Products Search Products Videos Planner Blog Catalogue Find Store About Library MENU Teak, crafts and innovation Home Products Materials teak Teak Teak is a close grained hardwood with a high natural oil content. This makes it hard wearing, highly resistant to rotting and almost impervious to the effects of sun, rain, frost or snow. These characteristics combine to make it the ideal timber for all outdoor applications. Only premium grade plantation-grown teak is used for the manufacture of Gloster furniture. The features of premium grade teak are a straight grain structure, the absence of knots, splits or cracks and an even overall colour. INDOOR USE Gloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour. If you intend to use your furniture indoors or under cover outside (where it will not get wet), the teak will retain much of its original colour and the soft sheen of its buffed finish. Any marks, stains or damage to the buffed teak finish can be restored using the Gloster Buffed Teak Repair Kit. OUTDOOR USE Gloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour. As with natural finish teak, left to age naturally outside, buffed teak will gradually change to a soft, silver-grey as the pigments in the surface layer of the wood begin to fade away. After the first few exposures to water, you should also expect the surface grain to rise slightly. As a part of the buffing process, the surface is wetted before final sanding to raise the grain, so there will be significantly less raised grain on buffed teak than on natural finish teak. We recommend that you allow your teak furniture to weather naturally this way and simply clean thoroughly once or twice a year with our Teak Cleaner. Buffed teak furniture may also benefit from an occasional light sanding to remove any raised grain and restore a smooth finish to the surface. Under no circumstances should a power washer be used to clean teak furniture as this will erode the surface. Because teak is a naturally oily wood, it is not possible to paint or varnish. Any paint or varnish applied will not adhere properly to the surface and after a short while will start to peel off. If you wish to retain the golden-brown colour of new teak we also offer a Teak Sealer. Application of Teak Sealer will not affect the strength or longevity of the furniture in any way, just its appearance. If you elect to use Teak Sealer you will be embarking on a regular maintenance programme as Teak Sealer needs to be regularly re-applied to provide continuous protection. If you intend to store your furniture over the winter, we recommend that you do so in a water-tight garden shed or garage. However, we advise that you do not move teak furniture from the garden straight into a heated indoor room for storage, as the sharp differences in temperature and humidity may cause the wood to split. To protect teak surfaces from staining and to help maintain the silver-grey patina on weathered teak, we recommend using our Teak Protector. Our Teak Protector creates an almost invisible shield which helps to prevent food (coffee, ketchup, red wine, olive oil, etc.) penetrating into the teak and causing unsightly stains. Teak Protector also helps protects the wood against the ingress of moisture, the adhesion of dirt and prevents mildew growth.

It is equally suited to a relaxed modern Los Angeles home as it is to a New York City apartment. The steel footrest is an added comfort for resting your heels. Thoughtful detailing enhances the simple design of this Lostine collection. Each thick leather seat has its own character and variations lending to the appeal of the material. The leather will vary in color and darken with age, like a great bag or a favorite pair of boots. The frame is made of a hard maple wood and sealed to protect the wood but keep the beauty of the wood's natural color. Made in the USA. This item is non-returnable. Excluded from shipping promotions.

Made-to-order means that once we receive your order, it gets included in a production run of that item and when it is completed, it ships to you directly. This reduces waste (we don’t overproduce inventory or cut into materials that aren’t needed), and keeps our small, hardworking team organized. We have a limited number of people on our team and a made-to-order workflow, so we are only able to produce a certain number of items each week in order to maintain our lead times.

Delivery Partners We use Royal Mail, UPS or APC to deliver accessories, small furniture & lighting. Delivery is Monday to Friday, we will notify you once the item has been sent and provide tracking details where applicable. For large furniture orders such as sofas, we use a specialist furniture home delivery team, who are experts in handling furniture to make sure your delivery goes as smoothly as possible. This service is a 'white glove' service and includes the following: Confirmation of your two-hour delivery window the working day before your agreed delivery date An estimated time of arrival on the day of delivery (this is a guide not a guarantee due to traffic and possible difficulties in earlier deliveries which are out of our control) Two man delivery team Unpack and position the furniture in the room of your choice Remove and recycle packaging We ask that you check the dimensions at the delivery address for access (including doors, corridors and stairs) as well as the area of intended use, before you order to ensure that the product is the right size for you and to enable us to deliver your order successfully. You must provide a clear route to the room of choice removing any obstacles from the exterior and communal areas. Goods that fail to fit into your property at the point of delivery are your responsibility as we have no control over this. Please also advise us of any parking restrictions, red routes or width restrictions ahead of the delivery. Access Checks If you are looking to buy a sofa but concerned that it might not fit through your doorway or stairwell then it's worth considering using our access check service. For an additional fee a trained member of our team will visit your home to measure up, giving you piece of mind before you buy. Get in touch to find out pricing and further details. Removal of existing furniture As part of the white glove service we can also remove your old furniture for an extra fee, which must be arranged with us prior to delivery. We reserve the right to refuse collection of unhygienic furniture for health and safety reasons. Please get in touch to find out further details.

Order sample cards and you’ll see what we mean. MARK OF AUTHENTICITY Emboss-branded logos are hand-riveted on all of our painted furniture. This is our signature mark of authenticity. ECO-FRIENDLY With a focus on quality furniture that can pass down to the next generation, we ensure it does not end up in a landfill. Pride in Bench-Built Craftsmanship Our painted furniture is the best in class. Our builders hand-select each piece of wood that makes it into a Maine Cottage piece of furniture. Every chair, bed, and dresser—each is built one at a time start to finish at a single workbench by a single craftsman who has complete ownership and pride in the finished result. Every square inch of the furniture is hand sanded to a smooth finish. Read More About Our QUality Why We Shine The sanding between coats is the labor-intensive step that sets our smooth finish apart. Finishers are meticulously trained to leave enough shine to allow for easy maintenance but not so much that it becomes highly reflective and susceptible to finger printing. Our paint finish also knows how to age gracefully. Over the years, it develops a patina of surface scratches that add to the charm of our furniture’s cottage style. Learn More About Our Finish Extra Guests? Beds, bunks, and trundles that keep everyone cottage comfy. Fresh Squeezed Warning: eye-popping paint colors so fun you might not be able to choose just one!

Avoid using abrasive cleanser that may scratch the plastic. Use a tub/tile/sink cleaner; non-abrasive, all-purpose cleaner; or a paste of baking soda and water. Apply the cleaner to the surface or on a damp sponge and rub gently. The plastic injection moulding process produces large numbers of parts of high quality with great accuracy, very quickly. Plastic material in the form of granules is melted until soft enough to be injected under pressure to fill a mould. The result is that the shape is exactly copied. Kannoa products are UV Resistant, and in this case Recyclable. Simplicity and Style Designed for durability, practicality and style.

Order Terms Payment & Financing: We understand that investing in hand-crafted furniture is significant. We offer the flexibility of starting your order with a deposit of just 30% of the order value. When you start your order with a 30% deposit, the remaining balance is due when your furniture is out of production. The remaining balance may be automatically charged to the card information on file. To place an order with a 30% deposit, call us at 507-289-6866 or checkout online and select '30% Deposit' under Purchase Options when you add an item to cart. Some products that ship within 8 weeks do not qualify for our deposit payment program. Build Times: Once your purchase is finalized with QW Furniture, your order goes directly into production. See individual product pages for detailed estimates of build times. Our posted build times are estimates and are not guaranteed. Remember, our furniture is handcrafted and must pass rigorous quality checks. Build time delays do not permit cancellation. Note that our build time may be extended over holidays due to our craftsmen and women taking time to be with their families. Order Changes: You can make changes to your order up to 48 hours from order placement without a fee. Changes after this time frame will incur a $100 change fee, plus any stoppage fees related to parts already ordered or cut, and hardware ordered. Cancellations: You may cancel your order up to 48 hours after placing it for a full refund. Cancellation requests after 48 hours may not be accepted, and a 30% restocking fee may apply.

It is your responsibility to inspect your furniture upon delivery to ensure there is no damage. Hand Crafted Furniture: Each piece of our furniture is handcrafted, with unique grain patterns and characteristics. No two pieces of furniture are exactly alike. We offer stain samples to visualize the finish in your home, understanding that finish colors will vary. For other product questions, please visit our FAQ Page or Contact Us .

Tell us what you are looking for, and we will get back to you as soon as possible Name Email * Comment Send About CH24 Wishbone Chair - Beech - Soft colours Carl Hansen & Søn CH24 Soft Wishbone Chair The CH24 Soft Wishbone Chair from Carl Hansen & Søn is a refined variation of Hans J. Wegner’s classic Wishbone Chair from 1950. While it carries the same timeless silhouette, the Soft edition introduces a new tactile finish that adds warmth and practicality. What makes the CH24 Soft special? Familiar elegance: Retains the iconic curved backrest and Y-shaped support that define the original Wishbone Chair. Soft-touch finish: The matte coating gives the chair an inviting, velvety feel and makes it easier to maintain, keeping the design looking fresh for years. Versatile style: The softened surface creates a subtle contrast when paired with natural wood furniture such as Wegner’s CH327 dining table in soap-treated beech. A gentle variation on a design icon Think of the CH24 Soft as a contemporary counterpart to the original Wishbone Chair — equally elegant, yet with a softer look and feel. It’s a fresh way to enjoy Wegner’s legendary design while preserving its modern Scandinavian character. FAQs What is the CH24 Soft? It is a special edition of Hans J. Wegner’s Wishbone Chair with a matte, soft-touch finish. How does the Soft edition differ from the original? The design remains the same, but the coating adds a smooth, velvety texture and makes the chair easier to maintain. Can the CH24 Soft be matched with other furniture? Yes, it pairs beautifully with natural wood pieces such as the CH327 dining table in soap-treated beech. Who produces the CH24 Soft today? It is exclusively made by Carl Hansen & Søn in Denmark. Technical Info Technical Info Dimensions: Height: 76cm x Width: 55cm x Depth: 51cm Seat height: 45cm Armrest height: 70cm Materials & finishes: Solid beech.

(Newton, Mississippi, United States) Perfect for us! We have an 80” tv and found it hard to find something that was big enough for balance. This is a beautiful piece of furniture that came assembled and was easy to put up. R Rosalinda G. (El Cajon, California, United States) The Wow Factor! This piece certainly gives the WOW factor, so easy to install and what transformation to my living room. I just love looking at it. E Eric Unique and well made Just what I was looking for, a minimalist and stylish floating TV stand. A unique blend of modern styling and a distressed finish, with clean lines and a nice range of grey and brown tones. It always draws the attention of guests who want to know where I found it. My 1970's walls are not very straight, and that did present some challenges when mounting. The included french cleat mounts are super strong. Be forewarned, the shelves must be installed BEFORE you mount the unit to your wall. They don't fit in from the front. This also means they can't be removed if you decide you don't need them, but they can be adjusted. D Dan Exactly what I wanted Good quality and something I can mount to the wall. Exactly what I was looking for! S Speranza Perfect! Very please with my purchase! The floating stand is beautifully made. Very good quality. Definitely purchasing more pieces to add in my home. R RS High Quality and Value, Excellent Cust Service! Very high quality and value floating AV cabinet that actually fits a large 36\" center speaker. Install was easy and customer service was very responsive as I was asking questions about the product, etc. Load More Information Why Choose Woodwaves?

Disainiprotsessis oleme pühendunud ja põhjalikud. Näiteks Voog tugitoolist valmistasime pea poolsada prototüüpi, kuni jõudsime vormi- ja disainitäiuseni, mis annab edasi meie visiooni – tugitool, mis näeb hea välja, kuid on sealjuures ütlemata mugav. Diivanid ja tugitoolid olgu ilusad, kuid sama tähtis on ka mööbli ergonoomika. Iga inimene on erinev ja samuti on erinevad ka inimeste istumisharjumused ja ootused mugavusele. Mõnele sobib jäik ja hästi selga toetav diivan, teisele jälle võimalikult pehme sohva. Seda kõike arvestame tootearendusprotsessis, et jõuda parima tasakaaluni esteetika ja funktsionaalsuse vahel.

More information View images Facebook Pinterest Twitter Leg Finish Options How Our Armchairs Are Made We build our armchairs up from a hardwood beech frame, using traditional methods and materials. With hand-tied coil-sprung seat, arms and back. Where cushions are used, what makes them so comfortable is the high down content (50% down, 50% feather in seat, and 70% down, 30% feather in back). The down gives the cushions lovely softness, while the feathers provide loft and spring. ​ Where castors are used, they have been individually hand-cast by traditional English metal crafters to a very high standard, and a variety of finishes can be achieved. We use the antique brass finish as standard. Where legs are used, they can be either tapered or turned and come in a variety of woods and finishes (see 'Leg Options' tab for more details). We use medium oak as standard. All of our furniture can be made completely bespoke. We want this to be your perfect armchair, so if you want it a bit bigger or smaller, softer or firmer, or anything else just ask we will do our best to accommodate. The price excludes fabric. If you need some help finding the perfect fabric, let us know. Fabric quantities for standard models in plain fabric are shown in the product description. F or patterns, and bespoke sizes, get in touch and we can advise on fabric quantity.

For sale items , we will contact you directly and provide a quote at competitive prices, however this only applies to metro areas within Australia. We want to ensure your goods arrive safely and with the least chance of damage, so in most cases we will use specialised furniture couriers which may come at a higher price.

We will strive to deliver your items within the specified timeframe, however please note that lead times are an estimate only and they may change due to circumstances beyond our control. SOLID TIMBER DISCLAIMER Product images are for illustration purposes only and may differ from the actual product. You should expect colour, grain and other natural imperfections and variations on natural timber pieces, which is what gives them a unique charm. These will not be considered damaged pieces. It is not possible to request a certain colour as all pieces come in their own individual colour and finish. No two pieces will ever be the same. With solid timber pieces, we can never guarantee 100% that split/cracks will not occur.

Our gift cards have no additional processing fees. How soon will it ship? How quickly will I get my order? (production or lead time) At Oak For Less® furniture, we offer furniture from many different builders. Some are right here in Phoenix, AZ, while others are in California, or the midwest like Illinois or Indiana. Many of our domestic items are made-to-order and are built when the order is placed, so their production time is a little longer than others. We also offer a selection of items that are imported, so they often have quicker production times since those items are already made. Since lead times can vary, we give an estimated range. These lead times are APPROXIMATE , they are NOT EXACT . Items may arrive early or unexpected delays can occur with builders and/or shippers. These situations are beyond our control. By placing an order, the customer agrees that they understand the production time is our best estimate . When the order is ready for In-Store Pick Up or Local Delivery, you will receive a call to schedule it. Current estimated lead time is per builder item # prefix . For example, item OD-O-T462-Q has an \"OD-\" at the beginning of its item #. On our list below, OD- items have a lead time of 6 - 8 weeks. So item OD-O-T462-Q has a lead time of 6 - 8 weeks ** . Please remember this is an ESTIMATE and many factors can affect it. ** If your delivery location is outside of Arizona please add at least 2 weeks extra to these estimates to allow for the shipper's scheduling and routing delivery arrangements. Also, i f the delivery location is in a remote location or an area not easily reached by the delivery service, it may take an extended delivery time. Prefix: Approximate lead time: ES * Call for current production time * FA / FUS * Call for current production time * HM contact us for stock availability IFD contact us for stock availability OD 6 - 8 weeks SA 12 - 16 weeks SD contact us for stock availability TM 8 - 12 weeks If you don't see the prefix of your item # here, please call us at 480-962-9930 to ask about the current production time. Need to expedite your order? We're here to help. Call 480-962-9930 and we'll let you know if it is possible to get your order sooner. A few builders offer expediting for an extra charge. Shipping information Good news! We now offer nation-wide delivery for most products (w e have shipped all over the U.S. W e do not currently have a shipper to do Alaska nor Hawaii, and do not have international shipping (sorry!). We work with different shippers and they each have their own designated delivery areas of the U.S. - some areas may not be available, so please contact us to inquire about delivery to your area. The shopping cart will automatically calculate the type of delivery depending on the item(s) and delivery location. Or, if you would like a delivery quote, please email us at info@oakforless.com or call our store at phone number 480-962-9930 and include the items that you are interested in as well as the delivery city, state, and zip code and we will get you a delivery quote. Delivery services are made by experienced independent contractors. Delivery is available if the customer is located within designated delivery areas. Delivery contractors do their best to be careful when delivering furniture, but in the event damage occurs to walls, flooring, etc., the customer will take up any issues solely with the independent contractor. Customers must have the room ready for the delivery when it is scheduled. Delivery does NOT include moving old furniture or electronic devices such as TVs or audio/video components. If you ask them to do extra work, they will charge extra. With any delivery method, the customer is responsible for making sure that the items will fit through their hallways and into the room of choice. If the driver cannot easily deliver it to the room of choice (narrow hallways/tight turns/low ceilings/is asked to move other furniture) there will be additional cost that must be paid to the delivery service at the time of the delivery. Regardless if the furniture fits into the room of choice or does not, the customer is still responsible for paying the delivery fee, it is not refundable. If the delivery location is in a remote location or an area not easily reached by the delivery service, it may take an extended delivery time. Blanket Wrap delivery (states outside of Arizona) : Blanket Wrap delivery starts at $395 and goes up depending on the item(s) and delivery area. To be sure of the delivery cost for your area, please contact our store and ask for a precise delivery quote. Different blanket wrap delivery services serve different areas, so this delivery includes bringing the item(s) inside and either putting them in the first dry area (threshold delivery) or depending on the shipper for your area into the room of choice (1st floor only) - it depends on the service for your area. If your delivery requires stairs or steps or an elevator, we need to know in advance at the time of order because some shippers will not do stairs . Stairs or elevators may require an additional charge, it all depends upon which shipper it is. If you order a platform bed, Blanket Wrap delivery includes putting it in the room of choice, first floor, and also includes up to 30 minutes of assembling the platform bed. If you order a table, Blanket Wrap delivery includes putting it in the room of choice, first floor, but it does not include assembly of the table. If you require table assembly, please contact us at the time of order because some shippers will not do assembly. This may require an additional charge, depending on the shipper. Please note that Blanket Wrap delivery does NOT include attaching or reversing hardware or installing and arranging adjustable shelves inside of a bookcase or cabinet as this can be time consuming . It also does NOT include attaching a headboard to a customer's existing bedframe as the hole locations that need to be drilled into the headboard can vary depending on the existing bedframe . Blanket Wrap delivery outside of Arizona is a one or two person delivery. An adult must be at the residence to sign for and accept the item(s) in good condition. Basic delivery (within Arizona only) : Basic delivery covers areas within Arizona only. Basic delivery within Arizona starts at $95 and goes up depending on the item(s), if set up is needed, and the delivery area . Basic delivery includes the following: Placement inside the home - first floor, no stairs. This is usually a one-person delivery - the customer may be asked to assist the driver. This delivery does not include unpacking, debris removal, assembly, nor set up.
